# DevIdeas App (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js)

**DevIdeas App** is a web application built in Node.js using the Express.js framework.

It's designed to be intuitive and targeted at other developers/programmers/C. Scientists, etc., who'd like to keep their ideas for new projects in a safe place. Yet, even if you're not part of the I.T. world, you're totally welcome to use it, too.

It Uses Node.js and Express.js for backend infrastructure and logic, and MongoDB for data storage.

It also allows for easy unsubscription, in case you want to stop using it.

_Feel totally free to fork it and extend it._
